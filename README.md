# CSFLE Workshop Skeleton - M057 Tradecraft Mission

This repository contains the skeleton code for the M057 Tradecraft mission on client-side field level encryption (CSFLE). The mission is intended for anyone who is interested in learning how to use CSFLE to enhance the security of their MongoDB deployments.

The skeleton code includes several scripts and configuration files that participants will use to create and run a sample application. Participants will use CSFLE to encrypt sensitive data fields in the store's MongoDB database, such as user names, passwords, and credit card numbers.

The mission is designed to be interactive and hands-on, with participants working through a series of exercises that gradually build up their knowledge and skills in CSFLE. The exercises cover a range of topics, including key management, encryption and decryption, and best practices.

By the end of the mission, participants will have a solid understanding of how to use CSFLE to protect their MongoDB data, as well as some practical experience working with CSFLE in a real-world application.

# Usage

This project is intended as a starting point for the CSFLE M057 Tradecraft Mission. It provides basic functionality for encrypting and decrypting sensitive data. You can use it as a reference for implementing client-side field level encryption in your own projects.
